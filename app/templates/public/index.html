                PIE MICROCOLONY TRACKING
            </h1>

            <hr>
            <p class="lead text-justify">Processing Images Easily (PIE) automatically tracks growing microcolonies in low-resolution brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy images. The program works for recognizing microcolonies in a wide range of microbes, and allows automated measurement of growth rate, lag times, and (if applicable) fluorescence across time for microcolonies founded by single cells. PIE recognizes colony outlines very robustly and accurately across a wide range of image brightnesses and focal depths, and allows simultaneous measurements of growth properties and fluorescence intensities with very high throughput (in our lab, ~100,000 colonies per experiment), including in complex, multiphase experiments.</p>

            <p class="lead text-justify">PIE is available <a href="https://github.com/Siegallab/PIE" target="_blank">online for download</a>; this website allows users to quickly determine whether the software works for their microorganism and imaging conditions before investing time to install the full program. Here, users can either upload a single image (<b>Colony Recognition Analaysis</b>) to determine how well PIE is able to recognize colonies of their microbe of interest, or a series of images at consecutive timepoints (<b>Growth Rate Analysis</b>) to view PIE-calculated growth rates and lags for growing microcolonies in their images.</p>

            <p class="lead text-justify">For <b>brightfield imaging</b>, ideal images for PIE analysis are slightly defocused, with dark outlining surrounding cells that are brighter than the background. For <b>phase-contrast imaging</b>, a wide range of imaging conditions are acceptable. (see example image below).</p>

            <p class="lead text-justify">Please refer to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/253724" target="_blank">the paper</a> for technical details.</p>
